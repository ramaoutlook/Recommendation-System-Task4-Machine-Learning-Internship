# üìö Book Recommendation System

This project is a Book Recommendation System developed as part of a Machine Learning internship task. It uses **Collaborative Filtering** to recommend books based on user preferences. The system is built using Python and deployed via a **Flask web interface** to provide interactive, real-time recommendations.

The dataset used for this project is the [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains information about books, users, and their ratings. The project follows a content-rich and practical approach inspired by a YouTube tutorial, with major modifications and extensions tailored to this internship project.

## üîç Overview

The goal is to assist readers in discovering new books that match their interests. By applying **Collaborative Filtering**, we identify patterns from user ratings to suggest books that similar users have enjoyed. This method enhances personalization and improves user engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Merged and cleaned `Books.csv`, `Users.csv`, and `Ratings.csv`.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Built a user-item interaction matrix using book ratings and applied cosine similarity to generate recommendations.
- **Flask Web App**: Created a responsive interface to allow users to search for a book and receive suggestions.
- **Deployment Ready**: Project is structured with `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, and model files for Heroku deployment.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

Dataset from Kaggle:
- `Books.csv`: Metadata like title, author, year, publisher.
- `Users.csv`: User demographic information (location, age).
- `Ratings.csv`: Ratings provided by users for different books.
